## Annotation
In this work we observe extreme weather condition predictions, we particularly focus on
floods. We make predictions in short-term periods assuming we have stationary time series
and in long-term periods assuming we have not stationary time series. The main feature of
this problem is that we want to predict extreme values with high accuracy, whether prediction
of low values is not very sufficient.
